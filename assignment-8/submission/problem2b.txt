The first two assignments generated many fewer actions than later assignments. Supposedly they were less work. Assignment 3 seems to have required the most work. Without knowing more about the nature of assignments and resubmission policy, it is hard to make inference or hypotheses about the work load. For example if only one submission per assignment is allowed, it would seem that very few people submitted the first two assignments.
