In producing the plots I made the following assumptions: the list of agencies for problem 1_1 and the parameter k for problem 1_1 are not very large. For larger lists bar widths and type size, orientation, or line breaks would need to be adjusted. After trying different colors manually and using Brewer palettes, I opted to use one color for the plots, since colors do not carry any relevant information.
