Part 2.

The graph from part 1 is modified by color-coding each point to represent the agency that has the most complaints in the given zip code. The complaint number plotted still counts complaints for all agencies, which may be poor presentation of information. For clarity, I would probably create separate graphs for total complaint counts and complaint counts for the agency with the most complaints.
The data was read without parsing dates to save time. The code for parsing dates is included, but it significantly increases csv read time. 'Incident Zip' field needed to be cleaned. I used pandas string functions with simple regular expressions to convert ZIP+4 values to 5-digit zips and then remove any values containing non-numeric characters. I did not further clean or subset the zip codes, since invalid zip codes would automatically disappear when joining the grouped complaint counts with the population table. I assumed the zip code values in the population table were all valid.

The plot has no points for 'DOB' agency. This does not appear to be a mistake. It looks like 'DOB' was never the agency that received the most complaints in any zip code. Also most of the 'TLC' points have only 1 complaint. This also appears to be true to the data. 'TLC' seems to only have the most complaints per zip code in zip codes with very few complaints, with the exception of a few zip codes that have more than 20 but fewer than 50 complaints and one or two zip codes with over 100 complaints.
