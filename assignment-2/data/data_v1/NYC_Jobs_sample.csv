The Division of Preservation Finance administers multiple loan programs including the 8A Loan Program, the Participation Loan Program program, the HUD Multifamily Loan Program and the LIHTC Preservation (Year 15) Program. These programs facilitate the rehabilitation of privately-owned multifamily buildings throughout New York City.     The Primary Prevention Program, a joint initiative between the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), uses funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to offer grants to building owners for lead treatment. This initiative addresses a serious environmental threat to young children that results from deteriorated lead-based paint in apartments. The program, part of a broad City strategy to lower the hazards from lead-based paint, provides grants to owners of single and multi-unit apartment houses built before 1960, the year New York City banned the use of lead-based paint. In addition to federal funds, the Primary Prevention Program is also supported by City Capital money to address lead-based paint hazards citywide. The Program gives owners the means to make their buildings lead-safe through low-level interim treatment and by restoring non-intact painted surfaces to an intact condition.     The Project Manager will carry out project coordination duties for PPP, which will include supervising assigned projects from application to construction completion; working directly with building owners and tenants; working closely with and assisting HPD field staff as well as personnel from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; participating in monthly task force meetings and conducting tenant meetings;  assisting the public with inquiries on lead grant qualifications; being responsible for data input into the Divisionâ€™s tracking systems, and providing technical assistance to processing staff within the Divisionâ€™s rehabilitation loan programs on compliance with lead paint abatement requirements.
